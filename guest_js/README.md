# Sample: `wasi:http` in JavaScript

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/bytecodealliance/sample-wasi-http-js)

An example project showing how to build a spec-compliant
[`wasi:http/proxy`][wasi-http] server for WASI 0.2 written in JavaScript.

## Routes

The following HTTP routes are available from the component:

```text
/               # Hello world
/sleep          # Sleep for {ms} milliseconds
/echo           # Echo the HTTP body
/echo-headers   # Echo the HTTP headers
/upload         # Echo uploaded blob
```

Testing routes:

```bash
# Hello world
$ curl localhost:8080
# Sleep for {ms} milliseconds
$ curl localhost:8080/sleep/2000
# Echo the HTTP body
$ curl -d "Test echo body" localhost:8080/echo
# Echo the HTTP headers
$ curl -H "X-Test-Header: 123" localhost:8080/echo-headers
# Echo uploaded blob
$ echo "Hello World!" > test_file.txt
$ curl -H "Content-Type: text/plain" --data-binary @test_file.txt http://localhost:8080/upload
```

## Quick Start
The project uses [`Wasmtime`][wasmtime] as its runtime. However, if needed, it
can easily be adjusted to use [`jco`][jco] instead. For `wasmtime` installation,
simply run:

```bash
$ curl https://wasmtime.dev/install.sh -sSf | bash
```

The quickest way to start is by using [`just`][just].
```bash
$ just serve # to build and serve the wasm component on `localhost:8080`
$ curl localhost:8080 # to send requests to component.
```

Alternatively, run:

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run build
$ wasmtime serve -S common dist/sample-wasi-http-js.wasm
```
